# Tweet-bot
This code is a simple Python script that automates logging into Twitter, posting a tweet, and then logging out. The script uses Selenium WebDriver to automate the browser interactions.

# Installation
# Requirements
Python 3.6 or later
Selenium WebDriver
Google Chrome
To install Selenium WebDriver, run the following command:

# Copy code
pip install selenium
You also need to download the appropriate version of the ChromeDriver executable that matches your version of Google Chrome. You can download it from the following link: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

# Usage
Before running the script, you need to update the TWITTER_USERNAME and TWITTER_PASSWORD variables with your Twitter login credentials.

To run the script, simply execute the twitter_bot.py file from your Python environment:

# Copy code
python twitter_bot.py

The script will then open up a Chrome browser window and navigate to the Twitter login page. It will then log in using the specified username and password, post a tweet, and then log out.
